Goal: To produce diagrams that clearly describe the components and processes of a codebase.

V1: Takes a C codebase and a starting function as input and outputs a sequential and hierarchical list of function calls that occur in that function.

V2: Convert the list into a diagram, can change the list into a diagram script for websites like:
	-GraphViz
	-diagrams.code
	-mermaid online editor
	-excalidraw

V3: More details of each function (ex. parent file, parameters, returns), more customization/settings from user, compatible with different languages (C, Python, ...)
